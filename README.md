# Packing Line Automation Project ‚Äì Mechatronics III

## üì¶ Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing an automated packing line for blocks with dimensions **600√ó200√ó300 mm** onto a standard **Euro pallet (1200√ó800 mm)** in alternating layouts A and B. The line integrates **weighing**, **layer stacking**, and **pallet wrapping** systems. The project is a part of the *Mechatronics III* curriculum.

## üõ†Ô∏è Line Description

### Flow of the Process:

1. **Initial Conveyor**  
   A forklift loads the blocks onto the first conveyor.

2. **Weighing Station**  
   Blocks are moved onto a second conveyor with a **weighing system**.
   - If the block **weighs less or more than 50 kg**, it is automatically **rejected** onto a side container on the next conveyor.
   - Only blocks with a valid weight continue on the main conveyor.

3. **Robot Palletizing**  
   A robot picks the accepted blocks and stacks them on a **Euro pallet**.
   - The pallet is stacked in **alternating layers (A and B)**.
   - The operator can choose to stack **5, 8, or 10 layers** via the control panel.

4. **Wrapping Station**  
   Once the pallet is full, it is moved to the **wrapping station**.
   - After wrapping is complete, a **signal light** notifies that the product is ready.
   - A forklift operator then moves the pallet to storage.

## üéõÔ∏è Operator Control Panel

The control panel includes:
- **Start/Stop** buttons for the entire line.
- **Layer selection**: choose between 5, 8, or 10 layers.
- **Live weight display** for each block.
- **Status indicators** showing the presence of a block on each conveyor segment.

## üìê Design Specifications

- Conveyor dimensions:
  - **Standard conveyors**: 1800√ó400 mm
  - **Conveyor before and after the Euro pallet**: 1400√ó1000 mm

- Euro pallet: 1200√ó800 mm
- Block dimensions: 600√ó200√ó300 mm
- Weight tolerance: **50 kg ¬± 0**

## ü§ñ Robot Requirements

The selected robot should:
- Be capable of handling **blocks weighing up to 50 kg**
- Reach the maximum pallet stacking height (based on 10 layers)
- Be compatible with the palletizing pattern A/B
